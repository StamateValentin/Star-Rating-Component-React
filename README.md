# Rate Star Animation For React

This is a simple 5/five star animation component for React apps using typescript and state management.

## Installation

Make a folder with the same name as the `.tsx` file and place the repo files inside it. 
If your react app is using only `JSX` then you can simply change the `.tsx` extension with `.jsx` and solve the possible type errors. You don't need anything else. You can easy customize it.
